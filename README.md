Kebabskals Orthreus62 QMK Fork
------------------------------
This is a fork of [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) to be used with my customly designed Orthreus 62 keyboard.


The actual code was originally generated by [kbfirmware.com](https://kbfirmware.com) and later hand modified by me. The plan is to have it integrated in the main repo.

Designed to be used with a swedish keymap in windows. Other layers add simple support for some coding symbols.
Arrow clusters on both hands. Custom Alt+Tab mapping.

This is a *Work in progress*.
